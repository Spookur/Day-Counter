# Day-Counter
**Minecraft Bedrock Day Counter Add-On**

Make sure to enable the "Beta APIs" experimental toggle under world settings!

When new versions of Minecraft come out, this mod will likely need to be updated. To make things easier, update the UUID in manifest.json and/or delete the outdated version of the mod! Ensure that the version numbers are correct for the dependencies, engine, etc.

Players are permitted to modify/edit this pack. If you are a content creator and you are interested in using my add-ons, please reference them using the MCPEDL page.
